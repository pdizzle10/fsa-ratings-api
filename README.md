Playing around with Pandas, Seaborn, and APIs.

I used the Food Standards Agency's open API about food safety ratings for businesses in Leeds. The API is accessed here: https://ratings.food.gov.uk/open-data/en-GB

I pulled in the data in JSON format before using Pandas to clean and organise. I then plotted some simple graphs using Seaborn and saved these in png format.
